Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	try_me

rule try_me:
    output: outputs/4
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: id=4

Error in rule try_me:
    jobid: 0
    output: outputs/4
    shell:
         touch outputs/<built-in function id> 
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
