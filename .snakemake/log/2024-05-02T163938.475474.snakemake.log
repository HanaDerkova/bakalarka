Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job train_model since they might be corrupted:
outputs/627/metrics.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
