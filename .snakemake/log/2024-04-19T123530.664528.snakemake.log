Building DAG of jobs...

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

rule train_model:
    input: data/gaussian.npy
    output: outputs/2/trained_model.txt, outputs/2/cross_entropy.tsv, outputs/2/data_vs_training.svg, outputs/2/metrics.txt
    jobid: 0
    wildcards: id=2

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 37 of /home/hade/Desktop/bc_thesis/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
outputs/2/cross_entropy.tsv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job train_model since they might be corrupted:
outputs/2/trained_model.txt, outputs/2/data_vs_training.svg, outputs/2/metrics.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
