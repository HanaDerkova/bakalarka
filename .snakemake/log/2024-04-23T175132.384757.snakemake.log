Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:

Error in rule train_model:

    output: outputs/11/trained_model.txt, outputs/11/cross_entropy.csv, outputs/11/data_vs_training.svg, outputs/11/metrics.txt
    shell:
        (/usr/bin/time -f "%e %M" python3 train_model.py data/gaussian.npy         -o outputs/11         -architecture chain         -ns 22          --fit 'd'         --opt_options 1e-06 1e-06 15000 10         --no_mean True         --threads 1          --training_opt 10 500 100   ) 2>&1 | tail -n1 > outputs/11/metrics.txt
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job train_model since they might be corrupted:
outputs/11/trained_model.txt, outputs/11/data_vs_training.svg, outputs/11/metrics.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
