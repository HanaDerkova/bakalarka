MissingOutputException in line 14 of /home/hade/Desktop/bc_thesis/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
no_m_outputs/88/trained_model.txt
no_m_outputs/88/cross_entropy.csv
no_m_outputs/88/data_vs_training.svg
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job train_model_no_mean since they might be corrupted:
no_m_outputs/88/metrics.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
